                Science
                and Technology, Zaria. The same year, the federal government awarded him a scholarship to study further
                at
                the University of London. In 1966, he completed the course and earned a PhD in Mechanical Engineering.
                In 1966, Ayodele Awojobi returned from England and was appointed as a professor in the Faculty of
                Engineering, University of Lagos. His teaching methods earned him the respect of his engineering
                students
                and he soon became quite famous around the campus.
                He quickly rose through the ranks and became the Head of Mechanical Engineering Department at the
                university.
                Later, Ayodele Awojobi went back to London to study for his Doctorate and returned in 1974. Upon his

                he was appointed as associate professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Lagos.
                One week after he was appointed as associate professor, he was the first African to be awarded the
                ‘Doctor
                of Science’ degree in Mechanical Engineering, at the Imperial College London. He received the degree at
                the
                age of 37, which is considered a major accomplishment, as the degree is only exceptionally and rarely
                awarded to a scholar under the age of 40.
                (DSc). This prompted the university to immediately appoint him as the professor of Mechanical
                Engineering.
                His natural tendency to educate motivated him to become a quiz-master on national television in the
                early
                1970s. He hosted the quiz-show, ‘Mastermind’, which consisted of weekly contestants facing questions on
                a
                variety of topics.

                <P> Ayodele Awojobi was also an inventor and while serving as a lecturer at the university, he
                    successfully
                    performed an experiment with his own family car, an Opel Olympia Rekord, and converted it from a
                    right-hand
                    drive to a left-hand drive.
                    He researched further with motor engines and was able to re-design the vehicle so that it was able
                    to
                    move in both forward and backward directions with all four pre-existing gears. This gave the hybrid
                    vehicle, which he named ‘Autonov 1’, the ability to achieve its highest speeds in a moment, in the
                    normal reverse direction.</P>
